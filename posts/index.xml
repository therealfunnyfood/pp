      <description>Programming is the process of making a set of instructions that you give to a computer to perform a task.
A program is a file that contains a bunch of computer instructions that run in sequence or together to perform the intended task.
There are many different types of programs, ways to program, and programming languages.
A programming language is made up of many different functions and things that help translate human language to things that computers can understand.</description>

I learned how to program in python in that class, and a bunch of other computer science topics and fundementals.
Halfway through the year last year, I joined Timber Creek&amp;rsquo;s Programming Team.</description>
